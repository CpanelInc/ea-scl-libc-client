University of Washington c-client library

This is principally used because CentOS pushed libc-client
into EPEL repository, which we won't rely on.  The consequence
of this is that we can't release the PHP imap extension without
the c-client library.

Finally, the c-client library lives within their imap package,
which contains imap libraries and utilities, along with the
c-client library.

This repo ONLY extracts the libc-client functionality, which is
a complete departure from EPEL.
